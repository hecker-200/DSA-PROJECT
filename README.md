Pathfinding Visualizer
This is a visualization tool for various pathfinding algorithms. It allows users to see the workings of different algorithms like Dijkstra, BFS, DFS, and A*, on a randomly generated maze. You can also interact with the grid to set start and end points, and watch the algorithms find the optimal path.

Features
Grid Setup: Visualize a grid of cells, each of which can be a wall or passable space.

Generate Maze: Automatically generate a random maze with walls.

Pathfinding Algorithms:

Dijkstra's Algorithm: Finds the shortest path from the start to the end.

Breadth-First Search (BFS): Explores all possible paths layer by layer.

Depth-First Search (DFS): Explores as far as possible down each branch before backtracking.

A Search Algorithm*: Finds the shortest path with heuristics to optimize search.

Animation: Watch the algorithms in action with smooth visualizations.

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/pathfinding-visualizer.git
Open index.html in your browser to start using the visualizer.

Usage
Generate Maze: Click the "Generate Maze" button to generate a random maze.

Set Start and End Points: Click to set the start and end points on the grid.

Run Pathfinding Algorithm: Click on the corresponding button (BFS, Dijkstra, etc.) to run the algorithm and watch the pathfinding process.

Visualize: The cells will change colors to indicate the algorithmâ€™s progress and the final path.
